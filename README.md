# Introduction
Web Linux is an incredibly light operating system that uses debian as its base. It uses a very basic desktop with a dock and a top panel. The system uses (on average) ~300MB of ram at startup (with no apps).

# Purpose
Web Linux is built to only run a browser, however, it is possible to run it with other apps as well (working on a new OS for that).

# Use Cases
This OS is good for use in schools where online applications are the only programs being used. It is also useful for any folks out there who just use their computer to do things on a web browser.

This OS is also useful for coffee shops or anywhere that needs a secure system that is very difficult to hack or tamper with.
